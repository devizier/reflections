Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it allow me to have full control under which version of code is more important for me

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks and clones are different from each other with the place where they was created. Fork is same with clone operation but fork it is instrument on the github.

Branches aren't branches of the commits, and they can be included in forks or branches.
