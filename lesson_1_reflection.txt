It was pretty hard to setup my first git workspace. But I think it'll be very usefull for me in future. Course Udacity is awesome!

I think that it's very usefull to have all versions of your code when I'll become advances programmer. Sometimes programs catch bugs and in order to find them faster you have to have previouse versions of your code.

I think that automatic saving is good when you are editing one file and don't want to lose something if you laptop shutdown or another faile happen.

But if manual commits are more applicable when you code big app where you need to have savings with names

------------------
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
------------------
Because version control system like Git is created for saving different versions in web apps or programms which contains from a lot of files which have a lot of relations between files.

Google Docs ussually doesn't have relations between files.
